# ComplexNumbers
In CS 318, I created a C++ complex class for Cartesian complex numbers, building constructors, a copy constructor, and overloaded arithmetic operators for seamless calculations. Additional functions, like magnitude and polar conversions, enhanced its versatility. This project taught me the importance of readability and user-focused design.
